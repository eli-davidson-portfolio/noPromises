# Pull Request Description

## Type of Change
- [x] ‚ú® Feature (non-breaking change adding functionality)
- [x] üìù Documentation update

## Description
Implements basic Flow-Based Programming (FBP) server with RESTful API for flow management. This includes flow creation, lifecycle management, process registration, and comprehensive documentation.

## FBP Principles Check
- [x] Processes remain independent (no shared state)
- [x] All communication is through ports
- [x] Information Packets maintain ownership semantics
- [x] Connections use bounded buffers
- [x] Network structure is separate from process logic

## Implementation Details
- Implemented RESTful API with gorilla/mux
- Added flow lifecycle management (create, start, stop, delete)
- Implemented process registry with factory pattern
- Added concurrent access protection with mutexes
- Implemented graceful shutdown
- Added comprehensive test suite
- Updated documentation to match implementation

## Verification
### Added Tests
- [x] Unit tests
  - Server creation and configuration
  - Flow lifecycle management
  - Process registration
  - Concurrent operations
  - Error handling
- [x] Integration tests
  - API endpoint testing
  - Flow management testing
  - Process registration testing

### Quality Checks
- [x] Code follows Go best practices
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] No race conditions possible
- [x] Resource cleanup is guaranteed
- [x] Error handling is comprehensive

## Breaking Changes
None - initial implementation

## Performance Impact
- [x] No significant impact
  - Uses lightweight gorilla/mux router
  - Efficient mutex usage
  - Minimal memory footprint

## Dependencies
Added:
- github.com/gorilla/mux

## Related Issues
Initial server implementation

## Additional Context
This implementation provides the foundation for future FBP features while maintaining a clean, maintainable codebase.

## Deployment Notes
Standard Go deployment:
```bash
make server-build
make server-start
```

## Final Notes
This implementation provides a solid foundation for building out the full FBP system. Future enhancements will include:
- Flow visualization
- Advanced monitoring
- Process implementations
- Network visualization
- Documentation server

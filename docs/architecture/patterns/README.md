# Architectural Patterns

This directory contains documentation for the core architectural patterns used throughout the system. These patterns establish consistent approaches for handling common concerns across different components.

## Core Pattern Categories

### API Patterns
- Standardized response structures
- Middleware chains
- Route setup and organization
- Request validation
- Error handling
- Resource management
- Testing approaches

### Component Patterns
- Standard component structure
- Component lifecycle management
- Port management
- Configuration validation
- Error handling
- Best practices for component design
- Testing strategies

### Error Patterns
- Error propagation and types
- Error wrapping
- Recovery mechanisms
- Circuit breaker implementations
- Error reporting and logging
- Metrics collection
- Testing error conditions

### Network Patterns
- Pipeline structures
- Fan-out/Fan-in patterns
- Load balancing
- Back pressure handling
- Dynamic scaling
- Network partitioning
- Flow control

### Server Patterns
- Server configuration
- Documentation serving
- Response handling
- Flow management
- Process registry
- Concurrency management
- Database integration
- Resource cleanup

## Usage

These patterns should be used as reference implementations when developing new features or refactoring existing code. They ensure consistency across the codebase and implement proven solutions to common problems.

Each pattern document includes:
- Code examples
- Implementation details
- Best practices
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Testing strategies

## Best Practices

When implementing these patterns:
1. Follow the established error handling conventions
2. Implement proper resource cleanup
3. Include appropriate metrics and monitoring
4. Write tests following the documented patterns
5. Maintain consistency with existing implementations

# Testing Architecture Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for testing strategies and patterns used in our Flow-Based Programming (FBP) implementation.

## Contents

### [Component Testing](component-testing.md)
Detailed patterns and examples for testing individual FBP components, including:
- Process lifecycle testing
- Data flow validation
- Port connection testing
- Error handling verification

### [Network Testing](network-testing.md)
Strategies for testing complete FBP networks, covering:
- Integration testing approaches
- Flow validation methods
- Error scenario handling
- Performance and load testing considerations

### [Performance Testing](performance-testing.md)
Architecture and approaches for performance testing, including:
- Load testing strategies
- Stress testing methods
- Benchmark suite design
- Metrics collection and analysis

### [Server Testing](server-testing.md)
Comprehensive testing patterns for the server implementation:
- Test server setup
- Mock implementations
- Integration testing
- Best practices

## Current Status

While most core testing patterns are well-defined, there are some areas still under development:

### Known Gaps
- Specific performance metrics and thresholds
- Load testing parameters and duration guidelines
- Tool selection for performance analysis
- Resource utilization guidelines

### Next Steps
1. Define concrete performance acceptance criteria
2. Establish standard benchmark configurations
3. Select and implement metrics analysis tools
4. Develop resource utilization thresholds

## Best Practices

The testing documentation emphasizes several key principles:
- Thorough test setup and cleanup
- Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- Proper resource management
- Effective use of mocking
- Clear test organization and structure

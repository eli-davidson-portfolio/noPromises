# Performance Testing Architecture

## Load Testing
- Implement gradual load increase scenarios
- Test with varying payload sizes
- Measure process throughput rates
- Monitor system resource utilization

## Stress Testing
- Test system behavior at resource limits
- Verify graceful degradation
- Test recovery from resource exhaustion
- Monitor error rates under stress

## Benchmark Suites
*Note: Benchmark specifications still being developed*
- Standard process benchmarks
- Network topology benchmarks
- Data throughput benchmarks
- Resource usage benchmarks

## Metrics Collection
- Process execution times
- Network throughput rates
- Memory usage patterns
- CPU utilization
- Port queue lengths
- Backpressure incidents

## Analysis Tools
*Note: Tool selection pending based on specific needs*
- Automated benchmark runners
- Metrics visualization
- Performance regression detection
- Resource usage analysis
- Bottleneck identification

## Open Questions
- Specific performance targets for different process types
- Standard benchmark configurations
- Tool selection for metrics analysis
- Resource utilization thresholds

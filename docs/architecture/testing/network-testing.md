# Network Testing Strategies

## Integration Testing
- Test complete flow networks end-to-end
- Verify data propagation through multiple connected processes
- Test network initialization and shutdown sequences
- Validate cleanup of resources

## Flow Validation 
- Verify correct port connections between processes
- Test data type compatibility between connected ports
- Validate network topology and cycle detection
- Test port capacity and backpressure handling

## Error Scenarios
- Test process failure handling and propagation
- Verify network behavior with invalid connections
- Test recovery mechanisms after process failures
- Validate cleanup on partial initialization failures

## Performance Testing
- Measure throughput of different network configurations
- Test network behavior under varying loads
- Identify bottlenecks in process chains
- Monitor resource usage across the network

## Load Testing
*Note: Specific load testing parameters still need to be determined based on production requirements*
- Test network stability under sustained load
- Measure recovery time after heavy load periods
- Verify memory usage patterns under load
- Test concurrent network operations

## Open Questions
- Specific metrics and thresholds for performance acceptance
- Load testing duration and intensity guidelines
- Recovery time objectives for different failure scenarios
- Resource allocation guidelines for different network sizes

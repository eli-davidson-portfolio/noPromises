# Resource Management

This directory contains documentation for resource management components and strategies in our system.

## Overview

The resource management system handles critical aspects of system resources including:
- Connection pooling and lifecycle management
- Resource lifecycle states and transitions
- Memory management and access control

## Components

### Connection Pooling
Detailed in [connection-pooling.md](./connection-pooling.md), this component provides:
- Generic connection pool implementation
- Connection health checking
- Adaptive pool sizing
- Resource monitoring and metrics
- Background cleanup and maintenance

### Resource Lifecycle
Covered in [lifecycle.md](./lifecycle.md), this describes:
- Process lifecycle states and management
- Port lifecycle and connection handling
- Network lifecycle and operations
- Best practices for resource cleanup

### Memory Management
Documented in [memory-management.md](./memory-management.md), this includes:
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Access control patterns
- Policy enforcement
- Configuration management
- Security monitoring and auditing

## Key Features

- Generic connection pooling with type safety
- Comprehensive resource lifecycle management
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Metrics and monitoring integration
- Background maintenance and cleanup
- Security-first design approach

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Cleanup**
   - Always use defer for cleanup operations
   - Handle partial initialization scenarios
   - Clean up resources in reverse order
   - Properly handle cleanup errors

2. **Error Handling**
   - Propagate initialization errors
   - Clean up resources on errors
   - Handle context cancellation
   - Maintain system consistency

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track resource usage metrics
   - Monitor pool utilization
   - Set up alerting for resource exhaustion
   - Audit resource access patterns

4. **Testing**
   - Test all lifecycle states
   - Verify cleanup procedures
   - Check error conditions
   - Test cancellation scenarios

## Implementation Checklist

1. **Basic Setup**
   - [ ] Configure pool sizes
   - [ ] Implement resource factories
   - [ ] Set up validation
   - [ ] Configure cleanup

2. **Health Management**
   - [ ] Enable health checks
   - [ ] Configure monitoring
   - [ ] Set up alerts
   - [ ] Implement cleanup

3. **Resource Tracking**
   - [ ] Track resource usage
   - [ ] Monitor utilization
   - [ ] Configure logging
   - [ ] Set up metrics

4. **Testing**
   - [ ] Unit tests
   - [ ] Load tests
   - [ ] Error scenarios
   - [ ] Performance tests

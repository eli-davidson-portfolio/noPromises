# Resource Lifecycle Management

This document details how resources are managed throughout their lifecycle in our FBP implementation.

## Process Lifecycle

### States
1. Uninitialized
   - Default state for new processes
   - No resources allocated
   - No ports connected

2. Initialized
   - Resources allocated
   - Ports ready for connection
   - Ready for processing

3. Running
   - Actively processing data
   - Ports connected
   - Resources in use

4. Shutdown
   - Resources released
   - Ports disconnected
   - Process cleaned up

### State Management

```go
type Process interface {
    Initialize(ctx context.Context) error
    Process(ctx context.Context) error
    Shutdown(ctx context.Context) error
    IsInitialized() bool
}
```

## Port Lifecycle

### States
1. Created
   - Port configured
   - No connections
   - Ready for setup

2. Connected
   - Channels established
   - Ready for data flow
   - Connection limits enforced

3. Active
   - Processing data
   - Handling backpressure
   - Managing flow control

4. Disconnected
   - Channels closed
   - Resources released
   - Ready for cleanup

### Connection Management
```go
// Port creation
port := ports.NewInput[T](name, desc, required)

// Connection
err := port.Connect(channel)

// Active use
err := port.Send(ctx, data)
data, err := port.Receive(ctx)
```

## Network Lifecycle

### States
1. Created
   - Empty process map
   - No connections
   - Ready for configuration

2. Configured
   - Processes added
   - Connections established
   - Ready to run

3. Running
   - Processes active
   - Data flowing
   - Error handling active

4. Stopped
   - Processes shutdown
   - Resources released
   - Network cleaned up

### Management Operations
```go
// Network creation
net := network.New()

// Configuration
net.AddProcess(id, process)
net.Connect(fromID, fromPort, toID, toPort)

// Execution
err := net.Run(ctx)
```

## Best Practices

### Resource Cleanup
- Always use defer for cleanup
- Handle partial initialization
- Clean up in reverse order
- Handle cleanup errors

### Error Handling
- Propagate initialization errors
- Clean up on errors
- Handle context cancellation
- Maintain consistency

### Context Usage
- Pass context through lifecycle
- Handle cancellation gracefully
- Set appropriate timeouts
- Cleanup on context done

### Testing
- Test all lifecycle states
- Verify cleanup
- Check error conditions
- Test cancellation

# Network Orchestration

This document details how networks are managed and executed in our FBP implementation.

## Network Lifecycle

### Creation
```go
net := network.New()
```

### Process Addition
```go
err := net.AddProcess("processID", process)
```

### Connection Setup
```go
err := net.Connect(fromID, fromPort, toID, toPort)
```

### Execution
```go
err := net.Run(ctx)
```

## Process Management

### Process States
1. Uninitialized
2. Initialized
3. Running
4. Shutdown

### State Transitions
- Initialize -> Running -> Shutdown
- Error states trigger cleanup
- Context cancellation triggers shutdown

## Connection Management

### Port Types
- Input ports (single connection)
- Output ports (multiple connections)
- Buffered channels
- Connection limits

### Connection Setup
1. Type validation
2. Channel creation
3. Port connection
4. Error handling

## Error Handling

### Error Types
1. Initialization errors
2. Process errors
3. Connection errors
4. Context cancellation

### Error Recovery
1. Stop all processes
2. Clean up resources
3. Propagate errors
4. Maintain consistency

## Best Practices

### Network Design
- Use meaningful process IDs
- Configure appropriate buffer sizes
- Handle all error cases
- Use context for cancellation

### Process Implementation
- Implement proper cleanup
- Handle context cancellation
- Use type-safe ports
- Follow FBP principles

### Testing
- Test process isolation
- Test error conditions
- Test cleanup
- Test data flow

## Best Practices Overview

1. **Performance Measurement**
   - Always measure before optimizing
   - Establish clear baselines
   - Use appropriate benchmarks
   - Monitor key metrics

2. **Resource Management**
   - Implement proper pooling strategies
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Manage connections efficiently
   - Handle resource cleanup

3. **Scaling Considerations**
   - Start with vertical scaling
   - Plan partition boundaries carefully
   - Implement proper health checks
   - Monitor system stability

4. **Testing**
   - Regular benchmark execution
   - Load testing under various conditions
   - Failure scenario testing
   - Performance regression testing

## Getting Started

1. Review the benchmarking documentation to understand how to measure performance
2. Implement relevant optimization strategies from the optimization guide
3. Plan scaling strategies based on your system's needs
4. Follow best practices for implementation and testing

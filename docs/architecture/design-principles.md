# Design Principles

## Flow-Based Programming Principles

### Message-Based Communication
- Components communicate exclusively through message passing
- Strongly typed message ports
- Buffered channels for flow control
- Backpressure handling

### Component Independence
- Processes are self-contained
- No shared state between components
- Clear interface boundaries
- Independent lifecycle management

### Type Safety
- Compile-time type checking
- Port type validation
- Configuration validation
- Error type handling

## Go-Specific Design Decisions

### Concurrency Model
- Goroutines for process execution
- Channels for message passing
- Context for cancellation
- Mutex for state protection

### Error Handling
- Error values over exceptions
- Error wrapping for context
- Panic recovery middleware
- Error type hierarchies

### Resource Management
- Defer for cleanup
- Context for lifecycle
- Structured concurrency
- Resource pooling

## Safety Guarantees

### Process Isolation
- No shared memory
- Message-only communication
- Independent error handling
- Clean shutdown

### State Management
- Mutex-protected state
- Atomic operations
- Transaction boundaries
- Consistency guarantees

### Error Recovery
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Graceful degradation
- State recovery
- Resource cleanup

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Package by feature
- Clear dependency boundaries
- Interface-based design
- Testable components

### Testing Strategy
- Table-driven tests
- Behavior verification
- Concurrent testing
- Resource cleanup

### Documentation
- Documentation-first approach
- Live API documentation
- Network visualization
- Clear examples
